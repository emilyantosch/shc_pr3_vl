= Introduction

== Where are we right now?

- Last time, we looked at SQL as the language in which we define our database.
- We learnt about different database objects and how they can help us achieve our business requirements.
- Today, we'll look at
  - what an ERM (Entity-Relationship-Model) is,
  - how we can use it to effectively conceptually design databases and
  - why conceptually designing a database prior to implementation can save us a lot of headache.

== What is the goal of this chapter?
#slide[
  - At the end of this lesson, you should be able to
    - design a database using the ER-model,
    - decide about which attributes, constraints and relations will help you achieve your requirements.

= Entity-Relationship-Model

== Basics
#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[What is an ERM]
  - Entity-Relationship-Model is model/diagram for the logical draft of the database
  - The focus is on the business requirements
  - This language is not implemented in any DBMS
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[A quick history of the ERM]
  - Introduced by Peter Chen in 1976.
  - An ERM describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge.
  - A basic ERM is composed of entity types (which classify the things of interest) and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (instances of those entity types).
  - Elements:
    - Entity: A distinguishable thing existing in the real world.
    - Relationship: Between entities.
    - Attribute: Property of an entity or relationship.

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Entity Abstraction]
  #memo[
    - An *entity* is a distinguishable thing that exists in the real world.
  ]
  - An abstraction of entities would be an *entity type* (comparable to classes in OOP)
  - Several entities make up an *entity set*
  - An abstraction of relationships is called a *relationship type*
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Entity Abstraction]
  #example[
    Imagine a company:
    - A company is made-up of departments and each department has a unique name, a number and a manager.
    - Each employee's name, social security number, address, salary and birth date is stored within our database.
    - We also want to keep track of the hours per week per project, keep track of the supervisor.

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Entity Type]
  - An *entity type* is a basic object in an ERM.
  - Represents a thing in the real world, like a car, a job or a person.
  - An entity type has attributes, such as a name, an address or an age.
  - A particular entity of that type will have values for each of these attributes.
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Entity Type]
  #memo[
    - An entity type therefore defines a collection of entities, that have the same attributes.
    - Each entity type can be defined by its name and its attributes.
    - The collection of all entities of a particular entity type, so all the instances of this entity type, is called an *entity set*.
  ]
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[ERM: Entity Example]
  - Categories for entities could be
    - actual physical objects, people, roles, organizations,
    - actions, interfaces or general information
  - An element is not an entity type
    - if it has neither attributes nor relationships,
    - only contains attributes that another entity type already has
  #question[
    What is a good name for an entity type?
  ]
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[ERM: Entity Example]
  #task[
    What are the entity types in the following examples?
  ]
  - A company is organized in departments.
  - Departments have a unique name, a unique number, a manager.
  - A department oversees a number of projects, each with a name and a number.
  - The company may store information about each employee like their name, their social security number and their salary.

]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Attributes]
  - Is the attribute relevant to the problem you are trying to solve?
  - An attribute must belong to an entity type (or a relationship type).
  - Some of the attributes of an entity are important in identifying the entity. These are called *key attributes*.
  - A good name for an attribute is unique within the entity type, but not necessarily across the entire model.
]

#slide[

  - Composite vs. Simple (atomic) attributes
    - Attributes which are not divisible are called simple or atomic attributes
    - Composite attributes can form a hierarchy
    - Composite attributes are useful to model situations in which a user sometimes refers to the composite attribute as a unit but at other times refers specifically to its components
    - If the composite attribute is referenced only as a whole, there is no need to subdivide it into component attributes
    - Composite attributes are attached to their component attributes by straight lines

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[Key Attributes in entity sets]
  - How can we identify an actual entity within an entity set?
  - Attributes must be used
    â†’ Key Attributes (also called identifying attributes)
  - Sometimes several attributes together form a key attribute (identifying attribute), meaning that the combination of the attribute values must be distinct for each entity
    - If a set of attributes possesses this property, the proper way to represent this in the ER model that is to define a composite attribute and designate it as a key attribute of the entity type
    - Notice that such a composite key attributes must be minimal; that is, all component attributes must be included in the composite attribute to have the uniqueness property
  - Key attributes are underlined
  - If two attributes are underlined separately, then each is an identifying attribute on its own

  #let left = [
    - Edgar F. Codd invented the relational model in 1970 and won the Turing price for it.
    - The model has become widely accepted.
    - The model is based on relations, that are subset of the Cartesian product.
    - Everything is modelled in tables.

  #heading(numbering: none)[RM: The model]
  - The relational schema describes objects and relationships as a relational schema.
  - A relational schema consists of a set of attributes
  - Each attribute belongs to a value range/type
  - A database schema consists of a set of relational schemas
  - A relation displays the current data for the relational schema
  - The set of relations is called the database (or the state of the DB)
  - An element of a relation is called a tuple, which is simply a row

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[RM: The model]
  - Objects are described using relations
    - Relations can be viewed as tables
    - But: Not like a spreadsheet table!
  - There can be links between relations
  - Attributes describe properties
  - Possible attribute values are defined by the domain
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[RM: The model]
  Informally:
  - A relational model represents the database as a collection of relations
  - Each relation resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records
  - When a relation is thought of as a table of values, each row in the table represents a collection of related data values
  - A row represents a fact that typically corresponds to a real-world entity or relationship
  - The table name and column names are used to help to interpret the meaning of the values in each row
  - All values in a column are of the same data type
]

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[RM: The model]
  Formally:
  - A row is called a tuple
  - A column header is called an attribute
  - The table is called a relation
  - The data type describing the types of values that can appear in each column is represented by a domain of possible values

#slide[
  #heading(numbering: none)[RM: The math behind it]
  #idea[
    - A Relation Schema $R$ is a set of attributes $(A_1, A_2, ..., A_n)$.
    - Each attribute $A_i$ is the name of a role played by a certain domain $D$ in the relational schema $R$.
    - A domain $D$ of attribute $A_i$ is denoted as $"dom"(A_i)$.
    - The $"degree"$ (or $"arity"$) of a relation is the number of attributes $n$ of its relational schema.
