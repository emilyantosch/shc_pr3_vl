= Assignment 1: Chemistry database

Download the script "chemistry.sql" from Moodle and execute the script in PostgreSQL.
1. Write a transaction to insert two new elements in table ELEMENTS and a new connection in table `COMPOUNDS` into the database. If an error occurs during one of the insertions, all changes should be reversed. In addition, the transaction should be logged in table `CHANGELOG`.

#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
- Solution via trigger:
```sql
create or replace function changelog_trigger() returns trigger as $$
declare
  action text;
  table_name text;
  transaction_id bigint;
  timestamp timestamp;
  old_data jsonb;
  new_data jsonb;
begin
  action := lower(TG_OP::text);
  table_name := TG_TABLE_NAME::text;
  transaction_id := txid_current();
  timestamp := current_timestamp;

  if TG_OP = 'DELETE' then
    old_data := to_json(OLD.*);
  elseif TG_OP = 'INSERT' then
    new_data := to_json(NEW.*);
  elseif TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then
    old_data := to_json(OLD.*);
    new_data := to_json(NEW.*);
  end if;

  insert into lab4_1.changelog (action, table_name, timestamp, old_data, new_data) 
  values (action, table_name, timestamp, old_data, new_data);

  return null;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
```
]
- Solution without trigger would just log changes as an insert in the Transaction itself.
- Insert into the db. Rollback is automatic.

]
]


2. Write a transaction to add
  - a new lab (ChemLab6 located at Building C, Room 101) into table `LABORATORIES`,
  - a new researcher (Sophia Neumann) assigned to this lab into table `RESEARCHERS`, and
  - two new reactions discovered by this new researcher into table `REACTIONS`.

If an insertion fails, all changes should be reversed. Additionally, log each change with a detailed description in table `CHANGELOG`.

#if is_solution [

INSERT INTO lab4_1.reactions (reactionid, name, description)
VALUES (101, 'Reverse Redox', 'Reverses all changes done by a redox reaction.');
COMMIT;
```
]
]

3. Create the view `V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS` to display information about all researchers in detail, including their full name, the name of their lab and the location of the lab. The view should combine data from the tables `RESEARCHERS` and `LABS`.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS" AS 
SELECT
  r.firstname,
  r.lastname,
  l.labname,
  l.location

  lab4_1.researchers r
LEFT JOIN
  lab4_1.laboratories l ON r.labid = l.labid;
```
]
]

4. Try to insert, delete, and update tuples in the view `V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS`. Which operations (`INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`) can be executed and which not? Explain your answer.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
BEGIN
ERROR:  cannot insert into view "V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS"
DETAIL:  Views that do not select from a single table or view are not automatically updatable.

= Assignment 2: Geography database

Download the script "geography.sql" from Moodle and execute the script in postgreSQL.
Write SQL queries for the following questions.

1. What is the capital of Germany?
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT CAPITALCITY FROM COUNTRIES WHERE countryname = 'Germany';
```
]
]
2. Write an SQL query to list all cities in the USA.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT cityname as name FROM cities ci
LEFT JOIN countries co ON ci.countryid = co.countryid
WHERE countryname = 'USA'
UNION
SELECT capitalcity as name FROM countries

]
]
3. Write an SQL query to find the capitals and populations of all countries with names beginning with the letter "C".
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT capitalcity, population FROM countries
WHERE countryname like 'C%';

]

4. List all rivers that are longer than 4000 km.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT rivername FROM rivers
WHERE length > 4000;

]
]
5. Identify the highest mountains in descending order of height.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT mountainname FROM mountains
order by height Desc;
```
]
]
6. List all cities with a population over 5 million in descending order of population.

#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
SELECT cityname FROM cities
WHERE population > 5000000
order by population desc;
```
]
]
7. Add a new language called "Swahili" and a new country "Kenya" with CountryID 19. Then, link the language and the country in table COUNTRYLANGUAGES. Write a query displaying all information about the country "Kenya" and the language "Swahili" that checks the completeness of the data.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
INSERT INTO languages (languageid, languagename)
VALUES (19, 'Swahili');

INSERT INTO countries 
(countryid, countryname, population, capitalcity)
VALUES (19, 'Kenya', 10000000, 'Nairobi');

INSERT INTO countrylanguages (countryid, languageid)
VALUES (19, 19);

SELECT * FROM countries co
LEFT JOIN countrylanguages cl on cl.countryid = co.countryid
LEFT JOIN languages l on cl.languageid = l.languageid
WHERE countryname = 'Kenya';
```
]
]
8. Create the view `V_LARGEST_CITY_AND_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN` that shows for each
country the name of the country, the name of the most populated city, the
population of this city, the name of the highest mountain and the height of this
mountain.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "V_LARGEST_CITY_AND_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN" AS
SELECT
  co.countryname,
  ci.cityname,
  MAX(ci.population) max_population,
  m.mountainname,
  MAX(m.height) max_height
FROM countries co
LEFT JOIN cities ci ON ci.countryid = co.countryid
LEFT JOIN mountains m ON m.countryid = co.countryid
GROUP BY countryname, cityname, mountainname;
```
]
]
9. Try to insert, delete, and update tuples in the view
`V_LARGEST_CITY_AND_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN`. Which operations (`INSERT`, `DELETE`, and `UPDATE`) can be executed and which not? Explain your answer.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
  - All three operations will not work, because we are A using Aggregate Functions and B are using multiple base tables. The only thing that would work are `INSTEAD OF INSERT ON` Trigger, that could handle insertion to base tables.

= Assignment 3: SQL-statements for the COMPANY example from Elmasri also used in the lecture
Letâ€™s revisit the company example.
1. Create a SQL statement which creates the view `V_PROJECT1`. View `V_PROJECT1` has the project name, controlling department name, number of employees, and total hours worked per week on the project for each project.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "V_PROJECT1" AS
  SELECT
    p.projectname,
    d.deptname,
    COUNT(e.empname) as empnum,
    SUM(wo.hours) as hoursnum
  FROM projects p
  LEFT JOIN works_on wo ON wo.projectid = p.projectid
  LEFT JOIN emp e ON e.empid = wo.empid
  LEFT JOIN dept d ON d.deptid = e.deptid
  GROUP BY projectname, deptname;
```
]
]
2. Create a SQL statement which creates the view `V_PROJECT2`. View `V_PROJECT2` that has the project name, controlling department name, number of employees, and total hours worked per week on the project for each project with more than one employee working on it.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "V_PROJECT1" AS
  SELECT
    p.projectname,
    d.deptname,
    COUNT(e.empname) as empnum,
    SUM(wo.hours) as hoursnum
  FROM projects p
  LEFT JOIN works_on wo ON wo.projectid = p.projectid
  LEFT JOIN emp e ON e.empid = wo.empid
  LEFT JOIN dept d ON d.deptid = e.deptid
  HAVING COUNT(empname) > 1
  GROUP BY projectname, deptname;
```
]
]
3. Assume the view `V_SENIORS` with following code is given.
```sql
CREATE VIEW V_SENIORS AS
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 45000
WITH CHECK OPTION;
```
- Explain the purpose of views in general and the function of the view V_SENIORS.
- Is it possible to modify the tuples in view `V_SENIORS`?
  - First think about it in theory.
  - Second try it out in a database:
    - Update the salary of one employee in view `V_SENIORS` and in base
    table `EMPLOYEE`.
    - Insert some new employees in view `V_SENIORS` and in base table
    `EMPLOYEE`.
    - Delete some tuples in view `V_SENIORS` and in base table `EMPLOYEE`.
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
  - The View shows all employees that have an annual salary over 45000
  - It is possible, since the view does not include group by or multiple base tables
    - However, the view does not allow updates to rows, where `salary < 45000`

= Assignment 4: Transactions

For this assignment, you need two distinct sessions (connections) to your
database. In PostgreSQL's pgAdmin you can just open two instances of either the CLI `psql` or the query tool, which will act as independent session.
The two database sessions are denoted as `session1` and `session2`, resp. For every task
include your statements and the corresponding output in `session1` and `session2` in
a table. Make sure everything is in chronological order. Example:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto), inset: 0.5em, [*Timestamp*], [*Session 1*], [*Session 2*], [0], [
```sql
INSERT INTO TAB1...;
```
- Result screenshot
```sql
SELECT * FROM TAB1; 
```
- Result screenshot
    ], [-], [1], [], [
```sql
SELECT * FROM TAB1;
```
],
  ), caption: [Sessions],
)

1. In `session1` run a command creating a table named `TAB1` with two attributes:
  - `id` with data type `integer`, `primary key`
  - `n` with data type `integer` 
  When is table `TAB1` visible in `session2`?
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
- The table is visible immediately after completing the `CREATE TABLE`-statement.
]
]
2. In `session1` insert the following tuples into `TAB1` within one transaction:
```
(1,1), (2,2), (3,3) 
```
  What content of `TAB1` is displayed in `session2` before and after you commit your changes in `session1`?
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
  - Before the commit, the changes are only visible to `session1`. After the commit, the changes are visible to both sessions.
]
]
3. In `session1` update the value of `n` to 33 for the tuple with `id` 3 (without committing). Afterwards rollback that transaction.
- What value of `n` (`id`=3) is displayed in `session1` before and after the rollback? 
- What value of `n` (`id`=3) is displayed in `session2` before and after the rollback?
#if is_solution [
#conclusion(title: [Solution])[
  - Before the rollback, `session1` shows `n = 33`, while `session2` shows `n = 3`.
  - After the rollback, `session1` shows `n = 3`, while `session2` shows `n = 3`.
