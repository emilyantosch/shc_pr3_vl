  title: "Databases Lab 03", university: [HAW Hamburg], institute: [TI IE4], seminar: [DBL], abstract: [
    This is the third lab of Databases. This lab focuses on improving your skills in
    dealing with SQL queries. There are tasks for both DDL and DML statements. It is
    recommended that you familiarize yourself with the assignments to allow a more
    effective participation in Laboratory 3. If you have questions or need any
    support, help each other, or use the forum in our moodle room.
  ], show-outline: true, author: "Emily Antosch", show-solutions: false,
)

You should work on the following assignments in fixed teams of two. Please note
that every team member must be able to explain all solutions of the team of two.
Please submit only one solution in our moodle room for each team of two. The
submission must be a PDF file with the name and matriculation number. Solutions
must be in digital format with intermediate steps and detailed explanations. You
can use any drawing tool of your choice to create the diagrams. If you have
questions or need any support, help each other, and use the forum in our moodle
room. It is recommended that you also familiarize yourself with the assignments
that do not have to be submitted and will be worked on during the lab to allow a
more effective participation. Deadline to upload your solution for assignments
1, 2, and 3: Friday, 11:59 pm bevor the laboratory. The remaining assignments
can be done during the laboratory.

= Assignment 1: Chemistry database

Download the script "chemistry.sql" from Moodle and execute the script in mySQL.
1. Write a transaction to insert two new elements in table ELEMENTS and a new
  connection
in table COMPOUNDS into the database. If an error occurs during one of the
insertions, all changes should be reversed. In addition, the transaction should
be logged in table CHANGELOG.

2. Write a transaction to add
  - a new lab (ChemLab6 located at Building C, Room 101) into table LABORATORIES,
  - a new researcher (Sophia Neumann) assigned to this lab into table RESEARCHERS,
  and
  - two new reactions discovered by this new researcher into table REACTIONS.

If an insertion fails, all changes should be reversed. Additionally, log each
change with a detailed description in table CHANGELOG.

3. Create the view V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS to display information about all
  researchers in
detail, including their full name, the name of their lab and the location of the
lab. The view should combine data from the tables RESEARCHERS and LABS.

4. Try to insert, delete, and update tuples in the view V_RESEARCHERS_DETAILS.
  Which
operations (INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE) can be executed and which not? Explain
your answer.

= Assignment 2: Geography database

Download the script "geography.sql" from Moodle and execute the script in mySQL.
Write SQL queries for the following questions.

1. What is the capital of Germany?

2. Write an SQL query to list all cities in the USA.

3. Write an SQL query to find the capitals and populations of all countries with
  names
beginning with the letter "C".

4. List all rivers that are longer than 4000 km.

5. Identify the highest mountains in descending order of height.

6. List all cities with a population over 5 million in descending order of
  population.

7. Add a new language called "Swahili" and a new country "Kenya" with CountryID 19.
  Then,

link the language and the country in table COUNTRYLANGUAGES. Write a query
displaying all information about the country "Kenya" and the language
"Swahili" that checks the completeness of the data.

8. Create the view V_LARGEST_CITY_AND_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN that shows for each
country the name of the country, the name of the most populated city, the
population of this city, the name of the highest mountain and the height of this
mountain.

9. Try to insert, delete, and update tuples in the view
V_LARGEST_CITY_AND_HIGHEST_MOUNTAIN. Which operations (INSERT, DELETE, and
UPDATE) can be executed and which not? Explain your answer.

= Assignment 3: SQL-statements for the COMPANY example from Elmasri also used in the lecture

Letâ€™s revisit the company example.

1. Create a SQL statement which creates the view V_PROJECT1. View V_PROJECT1 has
  the
project name, controlling department name, number of employees, and total hours
worked per week on the project for each project.

2. Create a SQL statement which creates the view V_PROJECT2. View V_PROJECT2 that
  has
the project name, controlling department name, number of employees, and total
hours worked per week on the project for each project with more than one
employee working on it.

3. Assume the view V_SENIORS with following code is given.
```sql
CREATE VIEW V_SENIORS AS
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE salary > 45000
WITH CHECK OPTION;
```

- Explain the purpose of views in general and the function of the view V_SENIORS.

- Is it possible to modify the tuples in view `V_SENIORS`?
  - First think about it in theory.
  - Second try it out in a database:
    - Update the salary of one employee in view `V_SENIORS` and in base
    table `EMPLOYEE`.
    - Insert some new employees in view `V_SENIORS` and in base table
    `EMPLOYEE`.
    - Delete some tuples in view `V_SENIORS` and in base table `EMPLOYEE`.

= Assignment 4: Transactions

For this assignment, you need two distinct sessions (connections) to your
database. In MySQL Workbench you might have to allow opening multiple instances
first. On Windows this can be achieved via 
Edit #sym.arrow Preferences #sym.arrow General (tab) #sym.arrow Others (section) #sym.arrow Allow more than one instance of MySQL Workbench to run.


The two database sessions are denoted as `session1` and `session2`, resp. For every task
include your statements and the corresponding output in `session1` and `session2` in
a table. Make sure everything is in chronological order. Example:

#figure(
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto), inset: 0.5em, [*Timestamp*], [*Session 1*], [*Session 2*], [0], [
```sql
INSERT INTO TAB1...;
```
- Result screenshot
```sql
SELECT * FROM TAB1; 
```
- Result screenshot
    ], [-], [1], [], [
```sql
SELECT * FROM TAB1;
```
],
  ), caption: [Sessions],
)

1. In `session1` run a command creating a table named `TAB1` with two attributes:
- `id` with data type `integer`, `primary key`
- `n` with data type `integer` 
When is table `TAB1` visible in `session2`?

2. In `session1` insert the following tuples into `TAB1` within one transaction:
```
(1,1), (2,2), (3,3) 
```
What content of `TAB1` is displayed in `session2` before and after you commit your changes in `session1`?

3. In `session1` update the value of `n` to 33 for the tuple with `id` 3 (without committing). Afterwards rollback that transaction.
- What value of `n` (`id`=3) is displayed in `session1` before and after the rollback? 
- What value of `n` (`id`=3) is displayed in `session2` before and after the rollback?
